- Minor security anti-patterns

## üîÆ Current Capabilities

### Supported Vulnerability Types
- **Injection Attacks**: SQL, NoSQL, Command, Code injection
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Reflected, Stored, DOM-based
- **Cryptographic Issues**: Weak algorithms, poor key management
- **Authentication/Session**: Session fixation, weak authentication
- **File Security**: Path traversal, unsafe file operations
- **Configuration**: Missing security headers, verbose errors
- **Deserialization**: Unsafe object deserialization

- **PHP**: Include vulnerabilities, superglobal usage
- **HTML**: Unsafe attributes, missing CSP headers

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### Auto-Detection Limitations
- **Language Auto-Detection is Glitchy**: The automatic language detection feature may incorrectly identify the programming language, especially for:
  - Mixed-language code files
  - Short code snippets
  - Code with minimal language-specific syntax
  - Files with similar syntax patterns across languages
- **Recommendation**: Manually select the correct language from the dropdown for more accurate analysis

### Analysis Limitations
- **False Positives**: Some secure code patterns may be flagged as vulnerabilities due to regex-based detection
- **False Negatives**: Complex, context-dependent vulnerabilities may not be detected
- **Multi-line Patterns**: Some vulnerabilities spanning multiple lines may be missed
- **Comments vs Code**: The tool may flag vulnerability patterns in code comments as actual issues

### Browser Compatibility Issues
- **Older Browsers**: ES6+ features may not work in Internet Explorer or very old browser versions
- **Memory Limitations**: Very large code files (>10MB) may cause performance issues
- **Mobile Keyboards**: Some mobile browsers may have issues with keyboard shortcuts

### UI/UX Issues
- **Long Code Analysis**: No progress indicator for large file analysis
- **Copy-Paste Formatting**: Some formatted code may lose indentation when pasted
- **Results Overflow**: Very long vulnerability descriptions may not display properly on small screens
